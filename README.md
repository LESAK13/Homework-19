# Homework-19

For this homework assignment, we created a React App for an employee directory.  Using old activities, I set the template for the app.

I created a Wire Character JSON file and set up the data.  I was not able to successfully place the buttons to sort and filter outside of the rendered character cards, so I put instructions at the top on how to filter and sort.

Using state, depending on what the user clicks, the directory is updated using the character's location and episode count.  To do this, I used a filter for the location and a sort for the episode count.

I also added a button to update the directory to the original state.
